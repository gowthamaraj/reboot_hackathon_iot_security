## iot_security best project for reboot hackathon : monitoring, securing, detection, prevention

In all our recent client deployments, IoT (internet of things) has been a topic of priority for the Security team. The Mirai and Dyn DDoS focused botnet attacks and a recent FBI bulletin have provided a wakeup call for the industry - IoT devices are actively being used as a conduit for bad as well as good. Popular tactics these days for attackers include repurposing IoT devices as proxies via which they can anonymously funnel their illegitimate traffic, and even using them directly for crypto mining.

The harsh reality is that IoT still tends to be an afterthought when it comes to security monitoring and this is only going to become more acute as a barrier to adoption. Gartner predicts that through 2020, the biggest inhibitor to growth for IoT security will come from a lack of prioritization and implementation of security best practices and tools in IoT initiative planning.


## Objective:

Monitoring and detection:
1. I used Scrapy library from python for analysing the network packet. The attributes such as window size, packet length, size... etc as input the K-near algorithm for training and detecting. 

2. Graphical interface is used for montioring & system the network, and DDoS detection.

3. Individual python modules are created to search for weak ftp/ssh pwd by brute force - this can be controlled by a website which is created with flask framework.
